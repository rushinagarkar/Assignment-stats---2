    "The critical value of Chi-Square in the table for a 0.001 significance level and 4 d.f. is 18.46. Our obtained Chi-Square value is bigger than this: therefore we have a Chi-Square value which is so large that it would occur by chance only about once in a thousand times. It seems more reasonable to accept the alternative hypothesis, that there is a significant relationship between age of child and photograph preference."
